Alternate version of previous project that was built with Flask and an older version of React.

## The idea is the same. This is a platform where people can come and share their thoughts and ideas. 
This is a place for friendly and open discussions where people can collaborate and promote intellectual discourse on any issue.

## New project structure
This new frontend is a standalone app fetching data from different APIs, rather than being a set of templates being rendered by the server. 

The goal is to build a system based on microservices architecture. 

## One microservice for each main feature
- content suggestion
- notification system
- messaging system
- convo lists
- room list
- user list
